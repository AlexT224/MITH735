## MITH 735 Research Proposal
My research topic is the impact environmental discussions in America have on cinema and media. The literature that I need to review revolves around topics in ecocriticism, ecotrauma, and ecocinema to name a few. I would also need to find any literature or texts that deal with digital projects involving digital media or films/shows with environmental themes.

**Research question:** How and/or why does discussion about the environment in the US impact the plots and themes of cinema with environmental aspects.

To answer this question, I will be comparing the plot and themes of a book that was later made into a show: Zoo. The book was written by James Patterson and published in 2012. The show was later aired in 2015 and ran for three seasons. Through close reading, I would be comparing the relationships, plot, and environmental themes between the book and the first season of the show. I will only focus on the first season because that it the only time when the show is even remotely related to the book. I have selected this story because it allows me to 1) be able to compare the cinematic environmental themes to a different medium 2) see how the message could have changed over even a short amount of time and 3) work with a story with strong environmental themes that is not often talked about within ecocinema, if at all. 

I have a couple of ideas on what I would like to specifically collect from these two texts. I would like to make two relationship network maps, using Gephi, to show how the relationships changed within the story, including the environment as a character. I would also like to make a visual display of the differences in plot by mapping together the show and text. By plot, I mean significant conversations, moments, and actions that helped to drive the story. By doing this, I can answer how the switch to a visual medium impacted the role the environment played in the narrative, how the environmental message changed, and overall describe how the change might have impacted important parts of the narrative. As of right now, I’m not sure how I would like to do the visual display of the differences since I don’t know what software is available.

I have already started doing research into ecocinema and the impact media has on the environment. I plan to continue this research while trying to find software that will allow me to show the differences in an adequate form. I would like to start finding the differences in relationships and plot between the two stories by the second week of April, making a spreadsheet of the relationships as I do so.
